First setup/install [RVM](https://rvm.io/) (or something like it, i.e. [rbenv](http://rbenv.org/)). It is a good idea to keep your dev environment separate from your system Ruby.\r\n2. Clone the repo (`git clone git@github.com:cloudant/sabisu.git`).\r\n3. Create an `.env` file to setup your environment variables (see [Environment Variables](https://github.com/cloudant/sabisu/wiki/Installation#environment-variables)).\r\n4. Source the file (`source .env`).\r\n5. Next run `bundle install` to install all gem dependencies.\r\n\r\nsabisu uses [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/). You'll need to have npm (node package manager) setup first.\r\n```bash\r\n    curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you have npm installed, you can install CoffeeScript with:\r\n```bash\r\n    sudo npm install`\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. You'll need to generate the js files needed for sabisu, to do so run\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n    grunt coffee\r\n```\r\n**TIP** you can also run `grunt watch` to update the js files everytime a coffee file has changed.\r\n\r\n7. Start sabisu\r\n```bash\r\n    foreman start\r\n```\r\n8. In your browser, visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).\r\n","google":"UA-49239808-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
